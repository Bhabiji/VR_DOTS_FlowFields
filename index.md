## Unity DOTS/ECS implementation to Flowfields

A complex performant way for a relatively simple topic

Starting with the basics to learn a necessary workflow for the future of Unity

### Summary

Unity has always been compared to the more indie side of game development, even in school Unity is advised over an Unreal Engine 4 C++ implementation.
While there are many reasons for the preference of Unreal Engine in the AAA-industry ( overall graphical fidelity, more customisability, Engine and scripting is done in C++... ), one of the reasons is that when Unreal Engine 4 is utilized by knowledgeable developers, performance can be highly improved through object management.
Because of it's C# scripting language, Unity has a less upper hand on the side of object control yet they are developing ways to improve object management by redesigning core elements of Unity, introducing DOTS (Data-Oriented Technology Stack). While DOTS still has many flaws and adds much boilerplating to the traditional way of the Unity scripting workflow, it is definitely a must for future development. To elaborate on the DOTS workflow, a basic flowfield pathfinding (using many "agents" or "entities" to show the use of DOTS) will be implemented following this workflow and analysed thoroughly.
